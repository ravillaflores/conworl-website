			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				There were more variety in music in the 1970s than ever before. 
				Music listeners had dozens of genres to choose from and many of them 
				rose to popularity at different points during the decade. Funk, Soul, 
				R&B, Pop, Hard Rock, Soft Rock and Disco all carved out their place in 
				the music world in the 1970s. The late 70s also witness the birth of another 
				young music style: hip-hop. Some of the best Rock N’ Roll of all time was 
				recorded in the 70s. From David Bowie to Led Zeppelin to Pink Floyd, the list 
				I could make would keep you scrolling for days. The 70s were a golden era for
				vinyl records. They were affordable to everyone and everyone had a record
				player. It seems like almost every song ever made in the 80s had a 70s 
				sample in it. Music equipment had finally given artists more than 4 tracks
				to work with and music became much more experimental than it was technically capable of being in the 60s.

			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				If ever a musical style defined a decade, Disco was the definition of the 1970s. Although its popularity was relatively short-lived, the genre hosted a great deal of songs and artists that people are still dancing to today and had a large influence on the fashions of the decade, too. Van McCoy's "The Hustle" has often been referred to as the definitive disco track and many people say it was the first disco song created.

				<p class="lead">
						The Jackson 5 were one of the biggest phenomenons in pop music during the late 60s, 
						and the last great group to come out of the Motown hitmaking machine before Marvin 
						Gaye and Stevie Wonder shifted the label's focus to more individual visions. The 
						Jackson 5's infectious brand of funky pop-soul was a definite departure from the 
						typically smooth, elegant Motown sound, as befitting the group's youth and the dawn of
						 a new decade. That youth, coupled with the merchandising juggernaut that sprang up 
						 behind them, inevitably got them tagged a bubblegum group. But they were far more 
						 talented musically than that label would suggest, especially lead singer Michael, 
						 and their material, while sunny and upbeat, didn't pander to its audience. Solo 
						 careers and overexposure gradually weakened the Jackson 5, but their best music still 
						 holds up surprisingly well as some of the most vibrant mainstream pop/R&B of its era.
