			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				In the ‘60s popular music had been characterized by its largely teen fan base. 
				When the portable radio was introduced; 
				it became even easier for teens to take their tunes wherever they went.

			<h1 class="display-4 font-weight-normal">SURF ROCK!</h1>
			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				Pop was traveling, and picking up influences — from the beaches of California, 
				bands like <strong>the Beach Boys</strong> were taking the harmonies from traditional pop songs 
				and layering them with the “surf rock” rhythm that they became known for. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<h1 class="display-4 font-weight-normal">MOTOWN AND R&B</h1>
			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				The "Motown Sound" and popular R&B music had a major significance in terms of the Civil Rights 
				movement and integration in American society during the sixties. Motown records consisted mainly of 
				African-American groups, singers, songwriters and management and their musical and business success 
				proved in breaking down the barriers of segregation and granted African-American performers and musicians 
				a chances to reappropriate much of the success that had been credited to white rock 'n' rollers and pop 
				artists who had success in singing "black music" during the previous decade.

			<h1 class="display-4 font-weight-normal ">The BRITISH INVASION IN THE 1960s</h1>
			<p class="lead font-weight-normal">
				But the true driving force of pop in the ‘60s came from across the Atlantic, with
				Beatlemania and the British Invasion into the American charts.
				The British Invasion brought rock and pop music and bands to the U.S., 
				where they became wildly popular. The Beatles were the ones who started the 
				phenomenon with their mix of beat, rock, and pop ballads immediately took over 
				American pop charts. It extended to other British bands, that took part in this 
				invasion included the English rock group, The Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, 
				Cream, and the Yardbirds were all making appearances on the U.S. charts.. 
				English rock groups were not the only ones who were dominating the U.S charts,
				but also individual artists like Tom Jones. Through all of this, not only the pop genre, 
				but also the rock genre was forming into something not solely defined by the American solo-pop 
				and rock artists/bands of the previous decade. Now, bands were introduced into the fray, and pop 
				was splitting into sub-genres that included Bubblegum pop—defined by its upbeat sound and its direct
				aim at teen audiences—and Baroque pop, which blended pop and rock and baroque music together. 
				Rock music sub-genres such as folk rock, surf rock, blues rock, and psychedelic rock were formed during 
				the British Invasion.

				<p class="lead">
						The Jackson 5 were one of the biggest phenomenons in pop music during the late 60s, 
						and the last great group to come out of the Motown hitmaking machine before Marvin 
						Gaye and Stevie Wonder shifted the label's focus to more individual visions. The 
						Jackson 5's infectious brand of funky pop-soul was a definite departure from the 
						typically smooth, elegant Motown sound, as befitting the group's youth and the dawn of
						 a new decade. That youth, coupled with the merchandising juggernaut that sprang up 
						 behind them, inevitably got them tagged a bubblegum group. But they were far more 
						 talented musically than that label would suggest, especially lead singer Michael, 
						 and their material, while sunny and upbeat, didn't pander to its audience. Solo 
						 careers and overexposure gradually weakened the Jackson 5, but their best music still 
						 holds up surprisingly well as some of the most vibrant mainstream pop/R&B of its era.
