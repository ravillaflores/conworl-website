The artist we know today was raised by a single mom, lived hand to mouth, on and off welfare, constantly moving from one place to another but still pushed himself to reach his goals. After dropping out of high school, he pushed himself to begin competing in local rap battles, which resulted in earning respect for his craft from his peers and overall music scene.

									Lavigne sang all the time as a child, much to the chagrin of her two siblings. Raised by deeply religious parents, she first started performing in church choirs. Lavigne learned to play the guitar and began composing her own music as a teenager. At first, she reportedly focused on country music, eventually changing her tune. Leaving high school, she went first to New York City and then to Los Angeles to work with Arista Records.

								Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of emo pop in the mid-2000s, selling more than four million albums thanks to the band's tabloid-grabbing bassist, able-voiced frontman, and handful of Top 40 hits. The group's four members first came together in Wilmette, a bedroom community north of Chicago, around 2001. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz, drummer Andrew Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman had all taken part in various bands connected to Chicago's underground hardcore scene. Most notably, Hurley drummed for Racetraitor, the furiously political metalcore outfit whose brief output was both a rallying point and sticking point within the hardcore community. As Fall Out Boy, the quartet used the unbridled intensity of hardcore as a foundation for melody-drenched pop-punk, with a heavy debt to the emo scene. They debuted with a self-released demo in 2001, following it up in May 2002 with a split LP (issued on the Uprising label) that also featured Project Rocket, for which Hurley also drummed. The band remained with the label for the release of a mini-LP, Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girl, but a bidding war of sorts was already in full swing.

A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later.

								Formed in Poway, California, in 1992 — when bassist Mark Hoppus' sister introduced him to guitarist Tom DeLonge, who was playing in a band called Big Oily Men — they recruited drummer Scott Raynor and began jamming out in DeLonge's garage. Originally saddled with the name Duck Tape, DeLonge rechristened the band as Blink, and they recorded a pair of demos (songs from the demos would later resurface on the band's first two albums). Drawing the attention of local label Cargo Music, they released their debut album, Cheshire Cat, in 1994. And though the album never made much of an impact commercially, it's often cited by bands and fans as an iconic release. Soon after, they drew the ire of an Irish band also named Blink, so they were forced to change their name to Blink-182. <br>
								In 1997, they released Dude Ranch, and thanks to the success of singles like "Dammit" and "Josie," the album sold more than a million copies. While touring in support of the record, they parted was with drummer Raynor (under somewhat mysterious circumstances) and asked Travis Barker — who was drumming with tourmates the Aquabats — to fill in behind the kit for the remainder of the dates. Turns out, he would never leave.

									Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as "foo fighters". <br>
									Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.

The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.

									Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter and dancer. He was born in Dallas, Texas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee until moving to Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, his mother put him in local singing competitions, before catching the attention of a music A&R from LaFace Records. He released his self-titled debut album, Usher (1994) but rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way (1997). It spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "Nice & Slow", among top-two singles "You Make Me Wanna..." and "My Way". 8701 (2001) produced the number-one singles "U Remind Me" and "U Got It Bad", as well as top-three single "U Don't Have to Call". It sold eight million copies worldwide and won his first two Grammy Awards as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002 and 2003.
