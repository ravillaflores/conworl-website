									Eminem started out not only in a broken home, but a series of them. The artist we know today was raised by a single mom, lived hand to mouth, on and off welfare, constantly moving from one place to another but still pushed himself to reach his goals. After dropping out of high school, he pushed himself to begin competing in local rap battles, which resulted in earning respect for his craft from his peers and overall music scene. Once he broke into the scene, there was no stopping the “rap God”.

									Ludacris was born Christopher Brian Bridges on September 11, 1977, from two parents who were college students. <Br>

At 12 years old, he moved to Atlanta. This forced him to quit his rap group Loudmouth Hooligans, but his career was far from over.	<br>
									Ludacris is one of the most influential rappers of all time, patenting the “Dirty South” sound alongside Big Boy, Andre 3000 and OutKast. In his decades in the business, he’s amassed Grammy Awards, MTV Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. He’s topped Forbes lists and transitioned to an actor in one of the most successful action movie franchises of all time.

								Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of emo pop in the mid-2000s, selling more than four million albums thanks to the band's tabloid-grabbing bassist, able-voiced frontman, and handful of Top 40 hits. The group's four members first came together in Wilmette, a bedroom community north of Chicago, around 2001. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz, drummer Andrew Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman had all taken part in various bands connected to Chicago's underground hardcore scene. Most notably, Hurley drummed for Racetraitor, the furiously political metalcore outfit whose brief output was both a rallying point and sticking point within the hardcore community. As Fall Out Boy, the quartet used the unbridled intensity of hardcore as a foundation for melody-drenched pop-punk, with a heavy debt to the emo scene. They debuted with a self-released demo in 2001, following it up in May 2002 with a split LP (issued on the Uprising label) that also featured Project Rocket, for which Hurley also drummed. The band remained with the label for the release of a mini-LP, Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girl, but a bidding war of sorts was already in full swing.

									My Chemical Romance (commonly abbreviated MCR or shortened to My Chem) was an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey, active from 2001 to 2013. The band's best-known lineup consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar, accompanied by keyboardist James Dewees. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later.

								Formed in Poway, California, in 1992 — when bassist Mark Hoppus' sister introduced him to guitarist Tom DeLonge, who was playing in a band called Big Oily Men — they recruited drummer Scott Raynor and began jamming out in DeLonge's garage. Originally saddled with the name Duck Tape, DeLonge rechristened the band as Blink, and they recorded a pair of demos (songs from the demos would later resurface on the band's first two albums). Drawing the attention of local label Cargo Music, they released their debut album, Cheshire Cat, in 1994. And though the album never made much of an impact commercially, it's often cited by bands and fans as an iconic release. Soon after, they drew the ire of an Irish band also named Blink, so they were forced to change their name to Blink-182. <br>
								In 1997, they released Dude Ranch, and thanks to the success of singles like "Dammit" and "Josie," the album sold more than a million copies. While touring in support of the record, they parted was with drummer Raynor (under somewhat mysterious circumstances) and asked Travis Barker — who was drumming with tourmates the Aquabats — to fill in behind the kit for the remainder of the dates. Turns out, he would never leave.

									Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as "foo fighters". <br>
									Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.

Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work.[2] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in their first two albums, the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.

									Born: Avril Ramona Lavigne was born on September 27, 1984, in Belleville, Ontario, Canada <br>
									She spent most of her childhood in Napanee, Ontario. For more than a decade, Lavigne has enjoyed huge success with her punk-influenced pop sound. She has also branched out in new directions over the years, including starting her own fashion line. <br>
									Lavigne sang all the time as a child, much to the chagrin of her two siblings. Raised by deeply religious parents, she first started performing in church choirs. Lavigne learned to play the guitar and began composing her own music as a teenager. At first, she reportedly focused on country music, eventually changing her tune. Leaving high school, she went first to New York City and then to Los Angeles to work with Arista Records.
